# Paddle Pop - Game Documentation

## Overview

Paddle Pop is a fast-paced arcade game built using Python and Pygame. The game features a bouncing ball, a movable paddle, and multiple targets to hit. The objective is to keep the ball in play while hitting targets to increase the score.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. Ball Mechanics

- The ball bounces off the **top, left, and right walls**.
- If the ball touches the **bottom wall**, the game is over.
- The ball rebounds upon colliding with the paddle.
- The ball also bounces when hitting targets.

### 2. Paddle Mechanics

- The paddle moves **left and right** to intercept the ball.
- If the ball collides with the paddle, it is redirected upwards.
- The paddle has a **jiggle effect** upon collision with the ball.

### 3. Target System

- Targets of **varying sizes** are randomly placed on the screen.
- Hitting a target increases the score by **1**.
- When the number of targets on the screen **drops below 5**, **20 new targets** are spawned at random positions.

### 4. Game States

- The game starts in a **paused** state with a menu.
- Players can navigate the menu and select **Play, Resume, Restart, or Quit**.
- Pressing **Enter** starts or resumes the game.
- Pressing **Space or Escape** pauses the game.
- If the ball touches the bottom wall, the game ends and the menu reappears with the "Replay" option.

## Code Structure

### **Main File (**``**)**

This file initializes the game and manages the core game loop.

- **Game Setup:**

  - Initializes Pygame and sets up the screen.
  - Creates instances of `Paddle`, `Ball`, `TargetField`, and `Score`.
  - Sets up sprite groups: `drawables`, `updatables`, and `targets`.

- **Game Loop:**

  - Handles user input (key presses for movement and menu navigation).
  - Updates and draws all objects on the screen.
  - Detects collisions and applies game logic.
  - Spawns new targets when fewer than 5 remain.
  - Pauses and resumes the game based on user input.

### **Core Components**

#### 1. `Ball`

- Handles movement and bouncing mechanics.
- Detects collisions with walls, paddle, and targets.
- If the ball falls below the screen, the game restarts.

#### 2. `Paddle`

- Moves horizontally to intercept the ball.
- Triggers a jiggle effect when the ball collides with it.

#### 3. `Target`

- Represents the targets on the screen.
- Gets destroyed when hit by the ball, increasing the score.

#### 4. `TargetField`

- Manages the spawning of new targets when fewer than 5 remain.

#### 5. `Menu`

- Displays game menu options (**Play, Resume, Restart, Quit**).
- Handles user navigation and selection.

#### 6. `Score`

- Displays the current score on the screen.

## Controls

| Key         | Action                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Left Arrow  | Move paddle left       |
| Right Arrow | Move paddle right      |
| Enter       | Start / Resume game    |
| Space       | Pause game             |
| Escape      | Pause game / Open menu |

## Game Flow

1. The game starts in a **paused** state with a menu.
2. Player selects **Play** to begin.
3. The ball moves automatically, and the player controls the paddle.
4. The player hits targets to gain points.
5. If fewer than 5 targets remain, **20 new targets** spawn.
6. If the ball touches the **bottom wall**, the game ends.
7. The menu reappears with an option to **Replay**.

## Installation & Setup

1. Install **Python** (if not already installed).
2. Install Pygame:
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Add **sound effects** for ball collisions.
- Implement **power-ups** (e.g., larger paddle, multiple balls).
- Improve **AI difficulty** (e.g., moving obstacles).

## Conclusion

Paddle Pop is a fun and engaging game that tests players' reflexes. It combines simple mechanics with a dynamic target system to create an exciting arcade experience. Enjoy playing!
